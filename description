Project name and slogen:

NoteLecture.AI
Your Lecture, Intelligently Noted

Project Overview:

An automated lecture summarization platform that transforms recorded lectures and presentations into organized, searchable, and easy-to-review content.

Core Functionality

The system takes a recorded lecture (video file or URL from Zoom/YouTube) and its corresponding presentation slides, then automatically transcribes and matches key lecture points to each specific slide in the presentation.

Main Components:
1. File Upload System

Video/URL input
Presentation file upload
Processing interface

2. Processing Engine

Video/audio processing
Speech-to-text conversion
Slide detection and synchronization
Key points extraction

3. Display Interface

Side-by-side view of video and slides
Synchronized transcriptions per slide
Edit/export capabilities

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React.js + TypeScript
Backend: Python
DB: MySQL
AI Services: OpenAI Whisper for transcription (additional AI services may be needed)
File Processing: FFmpeg, python-pptx (additional processing tools may be needed)

Key Challenges:

Accurate slide transition detection
Precise synchronization of audio with slides
Handling various presentation formats
Handling URLS for youtube/zoom videos
System performance and cost with large files

End Result:

A web platform where users can easily upload their lecture recordings and presentations, and receive an organized summary of key points mapped to each slide, making it easier to review and reference lecture content.
